<p>Telling stories on the web is old as the web itself. What changed over decades is <em>who</em> creates the story.</p>

<p>In the &#8217;90s to create web content you needed a web expert who could <em>code</em> HTML and was able to transfer the result to a web server via FTP.</p>

<p>With web2.0 the monopoly of the HTML gurus was disrupted with blogging platforms like Wordpress, Tumblr, and now Medium, Facebook, Pinterest and co. Web content democratized let anyone <em>create and publish</em> immediately text, images, video without any technical skills.</p>

<p>This era was characterized by participation; everyone started to flood the content streams with unimaginable quantity and quality of data. The olimpic spirit took over the web.</p>

<p>Presenting and packaging data had secondary or no importance. Content silos offered uniform interface for consumption and creation making every piece of information looking the same.</p>

<p>To stand out, premium players had to hire an interactive agency or a web design &amp; development studio to add personal and creative touch to their content.</p>

<p>Yet again experts needed to code content to web.</p>

<h2 id='a_possible_future'>A possible future</h2>

<p>Technology disrupts itself at a fast pace eliminating middleman. New tools will let content creators to design and develop beautiful stories live, inside the browser, without the need of third party experts.</p>

<p>The new black in web design and development are web components. They are living, pre-designed elements you can use to create rich stories. Photoshop for the web. Imagine adding a slideshow, a big background image, a perfect headline and excerpt to your web document with a click. All of them following your brand styleguide definitions.</p>

<p>This is the no-CMS (Content Management System) era. Nothing stands between the content designer and the final living product.</p>

<h2 id='the_current_state_of_storytelling'>The current state of storytelling</h2>

<p>The parts are ready but the whole experience is (years) ahead.</p>

<p>Web components took off this spring of 2014. Collecting them into brand styleguides and building web experiences with &#8211; I saw only at Lonely Planet. A Photoshop like drag-and drop live, component based environment is unseen yet.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s left to you, content designer, is to work closely with somebody who has ready all the web components you might need. And helps you assembly your story in a responsive way, driving your visitors attention to your editorial / business goals.</p>
