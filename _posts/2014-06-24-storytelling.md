## A short history 

Telling stories on the web is old as the web itself. What changed over decades is *who* creates the story.

In the '90s to create web content you needed a web expert who could *code* HTML and was able to transfer the result to a web server via FTP.

With web2.0 the monopoly of the HTML gurus was disrupted with blogging platforms like Wordpress, Tumblr, and now Medium, Facebook, Pinterest and co. Web content democratized let anyone *create and publish* immediately text, images, video without any technical skills.

This era was characterized by participation; everyone started to flood the content streams with unimaginable quantity and quality of data. The olimpic spirit took over the web.

Presenting and packaging data had secondary or no importance. Content silos offered uniform interface for consumption and creation making every piece of information looking the same.

To stand out, premium players had to hire an interactive agency or a web design & development studio to add personal and creative touch to their content.

Yet again experts needed to code content to web.

## A possible future

Technology disrupts itself at a fast pace eliminating middleman. New tools will let content creators to design and develop beautiful stories live, inside the browser, without the need of third party experts.

The new black in web design and development are web components. They are living, pre-designed elements you can use to create rich stories. Photoshop for the web. Imagine adding a slideshow, a big background image, a perfect headline and excerpt to your web document with a click. All of them following your brand styleguide definitions.

This is the no-CMS (Content Management System) era. Nothing stands between the content designer and the final living product.

## The current state of storytelling

The parts are ready but the whole experience is (years) ahead.

Web components took off this spring of 2014. Collecting them into brand styleguides and building web experiences with -- I saw only at Lonely Planet. A Photoshop like drag-and drop live, component based environment is unseen yet.

What's left to you, content designer, is to work closely with somebody who has ready all the web components you might need. And helps you assembly your story in a responsive way, driving your visitors attention to your editorial / business goals.
