<h2>rationale</h2>
<p>
  the goal of this project is to create a state-of-art responsive story replacing csongor's current portfolio. 
</p>

<p>
  there are many web designers and developers out there, a simple portfolio is worth almost nothing. A good storytelling incorporating the latest design & development trends might be unique in the industry.
</p>

<h2>approach</h2>
<p>
  with this project we will show how to create beautiful stories on the web for all devices.
</p>
<p>
  we will look for <dfn>beauty</dfn> which in our case represents the harmony between oneness / wholeness and diversity.
</p>

<h2>project plan</h2>
<p>
  we will create a couple of slides / single page sub-stories for the following concepts:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>project title, short description</li>
  <li>typographic grid</li>
  <li>classic, asymmetric, centered grid</li>
  <li>images</li>
  <li>common web components</li>
  <li>about the author</li>
</ol>

<h2>deliverables</h2>
<ol>
  <li>this story as a portfolio replacement</li>
  <li>a styleguide associated</li>
  <li>a set of re-usable web components with full documentation</li>
</ol>
