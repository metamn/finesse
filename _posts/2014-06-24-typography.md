## Typographic Beauty

Telling stories on the web is old as the web itself. What changed over decades is *who* creates the story.

In the '90s to create web content you needed a web expert who could *code* HTML and was able to transfer the result to a web server via FTP.

With web2.0 the monopoly of the HTML gurus was disrupted with blogging platforms like Wordpress, Tumblr, and now Medium, Facebook, Pinterest and co. Web content democratized let anyone *create and publish* immediately text, images, video without any technical skills.

This era was characterized by participation; everyone started to flood the content streams with unimaginable quantity and quality of data. Th olimpic spirit won the web.
